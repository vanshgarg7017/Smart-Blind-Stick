# Connection of Hardware and Sensors

**Ultrasonic Sensor:**
1. VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino board.
2. GND: Connect to GND on the Arduino board.
3. Trig Pin: Connect to pin 2 (trigPin in the code) on the Arduino board.
4. Echo Pin: Connect to pin 3 (echoPin in the code) on the Arduino board.

**Buzzer:**
1. Positive (+): Connect to pin 4 (buzzer in the code) on the Arduino board.
2. Negative (-): Connect to GND on the Arduino board.

**Moisture Sensor:**
1. VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino board.
2. GND: Connect to GND on the Arduino board.
3. Analog Output: Connect to analog pin A0 (moisturePin in the code) on the Arduino board.

**LED:**
1. Anode (+): Connect to pin 5 (ledPin in the code) on the Arduino board.
2. Cathode (-): Connect to GND on the Arduino board.
   

**NOTE:**
Make sure to power off the Arduino board before making connections and double-check the connections to avoid short circuits or incorrect connections that could damage components.
